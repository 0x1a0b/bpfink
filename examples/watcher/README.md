Simple watcher
==============

This example creates a `bpfink.txt` file and watch for changes, nicely displaying events.

Getting started
---------------

In order to see this working simply run `sudo ./setup.sh` and in another terminal
run `cat bpfink.txt` or `echo "foobar" | sudo tee -a bpfink.txt` to see events.
